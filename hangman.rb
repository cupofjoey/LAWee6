#Mrs. Fisher often teaches geometry vocabulary with a game of hangman.

#She has asked you to create a method print_puzzle that prints the row of
#dashes for a required, single argument, word.
#The number of dashes or spaces should equal the amount of characters
#in the word. print_puzzle can also optionally take a list of characters
#as a second argument that represents the list of guessed letters.
